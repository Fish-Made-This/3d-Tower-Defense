# Game #2 - 3d Tower Defense (Work in Progress)

This is my second try at some video game development in Unity. Slowly getting the hang of the camera controls and how the objects work in Unity. Although I'm not a huge fan of the 3d manipulations, it seems that most lessons learned have little to do with the added dimension. So I decided to give the 3d tower defense [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=beuoNuK2tbk&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR4u5jX8za5iU1cqnQPmbzG0&index=1) by Brackeys a go.

New stuff I learned so far
-----------------------------
- 3d model manipulation
- Simple AI instructions
- Instantiating new objects from code
- Using Unity effects

The game
-----------------------------
A simple 3d tower defense game.
